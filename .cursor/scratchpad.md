# GreenPrint Multi-Step Questionnaire Implementation

## Background and Motivation
The current pricing page needs to be completely replaced with an interactive multi-step questionnaire that guides users through a series of questions to determine their suitability for GreenPrint access. This creates a more engaging experience and allows for better qualification of potential users.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Multi-Step Navigation**: Need to implement state management for 6 different pages/steps
2. **Progress Tracking**: Loading bar and navigation arrows between steps
3. **Data Collection**: Store user responses throughout the flow
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Animated page transitions and loading states
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure questionnaire works on all devices
6. **Background Consistency**: Use the white glassmorphism background from the original code
